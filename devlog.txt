NEWER AT BOTTOM
THE GAME OF LIFE - APCS2 (2014)

May 23, 2014
FINAL PROJECT TIME! 

May 27, 2014
We further developed our idea today and then we met with Mr. Brown to discuss our project. Andrew Fan joined the team! Yay!
Mash: This is a one player game with two versions: Life and Stuy. Players will give outcomes they would like to see and use a spinner to generate a spinner. The computer will run, and then will show the results. 
Added: We will then take the results and store them for analysis. We will find the least and most common answers for each category. We'll figure out details later. 

Version 0.00 [May 28, 2014]
~Deciding flow of how the game will progress and what will be available to the player(s).
There will be a MASH.java file that will be the driver file. It will contain the main() method as well as other functions, including a spinner, a toString, various printing methods, user input (to be implemented later on), and other things. Current plans include a Category.java class that will contain an array or arraylist containing the possible choices. The driver method will use a while loop and go through the categories using a counter, removing choices based on the spinner's result. At the end, it will print the results. Statistics will be implemented at a later date.

Version 0.00a [May 28, 2014]
Andrew Fan: Added Category.java. May require additional methods. I used a LinkedList as the base because we'll be removing things from the categories very often.
