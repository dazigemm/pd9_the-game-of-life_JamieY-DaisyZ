==================================
This is The Game of Life, a version of MASH prepared by Andrew Fan, Jamie Yip, and Daisy Zheng of Stuyvesant High School for your pleasure.

HOW TO PLAY
~First, please compile MASH.java. When you run the program, you will be prompted with the following:
>Life or Stuy?
"Life" is the standard MASH game, where you have your house, your pet, your car, etc. 
"Stuy" is the Stuyvesant version, where the categories are more stuy-oriented.

You will be prompted to fill out the choices for each category. Please do note that some of the categories require integer selections.

After all categories have been filled, the game will play out. At the end, your data will be exported as the last line (hopefully) of one of the two files: Life.txt or Stuy.txt, depending on which game you played, and your results will be viewable in the Terminal window.

You can see the statistics of all the games played (on the computer only, unfortunately) by compiling and running Statistics.java. Unfortunately, both Stuy.txt and Life.txt are required in order for the statistics engine to work correctly. Also, only integer values will be processed, and any incorrectly inputted data will result in failure to see statistics.
